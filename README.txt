Hello and thank you for downloading Scythe and Pan Recolors!

It has always bothered me that you could not upgrade the scythe in Stardew Valley when you could upgrade everything else. When carrying the scythe in your inventory it would always stick out like a sore thumb, especially if all your other tools were gold or iridium. So, thanks to Content Patcher, it is now easy to recolor the scythe to match your other tools! (And by extension the copper pan that you can unlock later in the game. Why copper? Why not a higher level of upgrade?)

It should be noted that neither of these tools will be actually upgraded. They are just being changed to match the rest of your inventory. The names are not changing either so if you change the color of the copper pan to something other than copper, the item will still be called the copper pan.

I did the recolors myself, pulling the colors I used directly from the axe and the hoe from each quality of upgrade that are not their usual default color. I first took inspiration from the Iridium Scythe Recolor by DuosAngel for the idea in the first place but the rest of the upgrades for the scythe and the copper pan were all mine. 

Acceptable color values for both ScytheColor and PanColor in the config.json are: base, copper, iron, gold, and iridium

You can turn on and off the recolors for the scythe or the pan in the config as well. So if you only wanted the scythe to be recolored and not the copper pan you can easily do that. You can also mix/match the different colors if that is what you wish.

1.1 Update:

Milk Pails and Shears are now added to the mod! Thanks to some feedback I recieved on the first version of this mod, I have decided to include support for a few more farm tools to add onto the pan and the scythe recolor!

PailColor and ShearsColor options are the same as above: base, copper, iron, gold, and iridium

1.2 Update:

Now updated to reflect the changes in 1.4! The Golden Scythe has been added to the game so therefore I had to do an iridium recolor for it to match everything again. The two options for the Golden Scythe are gold and iridium
